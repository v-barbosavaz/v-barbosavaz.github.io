During my penultimate year of graduation at ESIEE Paris to become an engineer, I have been interned in the Audio-visual Information Processing Lab (VIP Lab) for the CAPES/COFECUB Research Program entitled Hierarchical Graph-based Analysis of Image, Video and Multimedia Data.

My research consists in studying this paper from the Visual Geometry Group of the University of Oxford :

> Lu, Erika et al. "Class-agnostic counting." Asian Conference on Computer Vision. Springer, Cham, 2018.

I have tested this new approach on other crowd datasets ([UCF-CC-50](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/ucf-cc-50/) and [UCF-QNRF](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/ucf-qnrf/)). The Neural Network is build with Keras on a TensorFlow backend.
